## Preface 

### Proposal
Onboard the following individuals as Sophons.

### Background

The first batch of Sophons is intended to be non-controversial, since this is the governance bootstrap phase. It is a mix of long-term community members and community-members-turned-contributors, with only one representative from the core team.

In the future we can look to expand roles to cover more stakeholders, notably Keepers and other key strategic users of the protocol with a stake in its success.
